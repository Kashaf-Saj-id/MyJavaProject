            Immutable Classes in Java
-------------------------------------------

An **immutable class** is a class whose objects cannot be modified once they are created. This is achieved by:

1. **Declaring the class as final**: This prevents subclassing, which could alter the state of the class.
   Example:
   ```java
   final class Emplo { ... }

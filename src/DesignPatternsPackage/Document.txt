1. DesginPatterns.java:
   - Demonstrates Singleton, Factory, and Abstract Factory design patterns with examples of their usage.

2. Singleton.java:
   - Implements Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of the class is created.
   - Uses double-checked locking to make the method thread-safe.

3. FactoryPattern.java:
   - Implements Factory design pattern to create objects (Circle and Square) without specifying the exact class.

4. AbstractFactoryPattern.java:
   - Implements Abstract Factory design pattern to create families of related objects (Cars and Dolls) with concrete factories for Red and Blue toys.

Key Concepts:

               Final Keyword Concept
-------------------------------------------

The `final` keyword in Java is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent class inheritance.
It can be used in three different contexts:

1. **Final Variable**:
   When a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed once assigned.
   This makes it a constant.
   Example:
   ```java
   final int max_speed = 120;

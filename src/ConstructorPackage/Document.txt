Package: ConstructorPackage

1. Construct.java:
   - Demonstrates constructor overloading and constructor chaining by creating objects of Minor class using different constructors.
   - Displays the roll number and name of students using various constructors.

2. Minor.java:
   - Minor class has multiple constructors with different parameter lists to initialize the object.
   - Constructor chaining is used to call one constructor from another within the same class.
   - Default constructor assigns default values.

Key Concepts:
- Constructor Overloading: Defining multiple constructors with different parameters in the same class.
- Constructor Chaining: Using 'this()' to call one constructor from another in the same class.

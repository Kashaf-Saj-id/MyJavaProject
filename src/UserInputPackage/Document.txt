                 UserInputHandler Program
---------------------------------------------

This program demonstrates how to handle user input in Java using both the Console and Scanner classes. It is designed to calculate a user's age based on the current year and their year of birth.

1. **Features:**
   - Uses `System.console()` for input (if available).
   - Falls back to using the `Scanner` class when console input is not available (e.g., in IDEs).
   - Validates user input to ensure the birth year is reasonable.
   - Uses `try-catch` blocks to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - **Console Input:**
     - `System.console()` is used for direct interaction with the user through the terminal.
     - May not work in certain environments like IDEs.
   - **Scanner Input:**
     - `Scanner` class is used as a fallback for reading input.
     - Handles both valid and invalid inputs through a loop and exceptions.
   - **Data Validation:**
     - Ensures the birth year entered by the user falls within a valid range.
     - Allows re-entry of data if input is invalid.

3. **Execution Flow:**
   - The program first tries to get input from the console using `getInputFromConsole()`.
   - If the console is unavailable, it falls back to the `getInputFromScanner()` method.
   - The user's birth year is validated, and their age is calculated.

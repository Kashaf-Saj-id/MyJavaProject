Package: CastingPackage

1. Casting.java:
   - Main class demonstrating both upcasting and downcasting.
   - In upcasting, an object of CastB is referenced by a CastA reference.
   - In downcasting, the CastA reference is explicitly cast back to CastB to access subclass-specific methods.

2. CastA.java:
   - Parent class with a method `show1`.

3. CastB.java:
   - Subclass of CastA with an additional method `show2`.
   - Can be referenced by a CastA variable but also adds its own functionality.
